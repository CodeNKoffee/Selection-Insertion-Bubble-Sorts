# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This Java program contains three popular sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort. Each of these algorithms is used to arrange a given array of integers in ascending order. Below, you'll find descriptions of each sorting algorithm along with instructions for using the program.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the input array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. In each iteration, it finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and adds it to the sorted part.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input array, removes one element from it, and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
